      "question": "What is photosynthesis?",
      "expected_answer": "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants make their own food using sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide from the air. During this process, plants produce glucose (sugar) for energy and release oxygen as a byproduct.",
      "contexts": [
        "Photosynthesis is a biological process where plants convert light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy stored in glucose molecules.",
        "Plants use chlorophyll in their leaves to capture sunlight and combine carbon dioxide from the air with water from their roots to make food.",
        "The basic equation for photosynthesis is: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy → C6H12O6 + 6O2"

    {
      "question": "How do plants get water?",
      "expected_answer": "Plants get water through their roots, which are like straws that suck up water from the soil. The water then travels up through the stem to reach all parts of the plant, including the leaves.",
      "contexts": [
        "Plant roots have tiny hairs that absorb water and nutrients from the soil.",
        "Water moves from the roots through the stem via a transport system called xylem.",
        "Plants need water for photosynthesis, to stay upright, and to transport nutrients throughout the plant."
      ],
      "ground_truth": "Plants absorb water through their roots from the soil and transport it through their stems to all parts of the plant."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why are leaves green?",
      "expected_answer": "Leaves are green because they contain a special substance called chlorophyll. Chlorophyll helps plants capture sunlight to make food, and it appears green to our eyes because it reflects green light while absorbing other colors.",
      "contexts": [
        "Chlorophyll is a green pigment found in plant leaves and stems.",
        "Chlorophyll absorbs red and blue light very well but reflects green light, making plants appear green.",
        "There are different types of chlorophyll, with chlorophyll-a and chlorophyll-b being the most common in plants."
      ],
      "ground_truth": "Leaves appear green because they contain chlorophyll, which reflects green light while absorbing other colors of light for photosynthesis."

      "ground_truth": "Plants need sunlight, water, carbon dioxide, nutrients from soil, and appropriate environmental conditions to grow properly."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the water cycle?",
      "expected_answer": "The water cycle is like nature's recycling system! Water from oceans, rivers, and lakes evaporates into the air when the sun heats it up. This water vapor rises up and forms clouds. When clouds get heavy with water, it falls back down as rain or snow, and the cycle starts all over again.",
      "contexts": [
        "The water cycle consists of evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and collection.",
        "Solar energy drives the water cycle by causing water to evaporate from surface waters.",
        "Water vapor in the atmosphere condenses to form clouds, which eventually release water as precipitation.",
        "Precipitation returns water to Earth's surface, where it flows back to oceans, rivers, and lakes."
      ],
      "ground_truth": "The water cycle is the continuous movement of water through evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and collection, driven by solar energy."

    {
      "question": "How do animals breathe?",
      "expected_answer": "Animals breathe to get oxygen from the air, which their bodies need to make energy from food. When animals breathe in, they take oxygen into their lungs. When they breathe out, they release carbon dioxide, which is a waste gas their bodies don't need.",
      "contexts": [
        "Animals use respiratory systems to exchange gases with their environment.",
        "Mammals breathe air into their lungs where oxygen is absorbed into the bloodstream.",
        "The breathing process involves inhaling oxygen and exhaling carbon dioxide.",
        "Different animals have different breathing organs: mammals have lungs, fish have gills, and insects have spiracles."
      ],
      "ground_truth": "Animals breathe to take in oxygen needed for cellular processes and to remove carbon dioxide waste from their bodies."

    {
      "question": "What makes the seasons change?",
      "expected_answer": "Seasons change because Earth is tilted as it travels around the sun. When your part of Earth tilts toward the sun, you get more direct sunlight and warmer weather (summer). When it tilts away, you get less direct sunlight and cooler weather (winter). Spring and fall happen in between!",
      "contexts": [
        "Earth's axis is tilted at approximately 23.5 degrees relative to its orbital plane around the sun.",
        "As Earth orbits the sun, different parts of the planet receive varying amounts of direct sunlight throughout the year.",
        "When the Northern Hemisphere tilts toward the sun, it experiences summer while the Southern Hemisphere experiences winter.",
        "The changing angle of sunlight and length of daylight hours cause seasonal temperature variations."
      ],
      "ground_truth": "Seasons change due to Earth's tilted axis as it orbits the sun, causing different amounts of direct sunlight to reach different parts of Earth throughout the year."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is the sky blue?",
      "expected_answer": "The sky looks blue because of the way sunlight interacts with tiny particles in the air. Sunlight contains all colors, but blue light gets scattered around more than other colors when it hits these particles. This scattered blue light is what we see when we look up at the sky!",
      "contexts": [
        "Sunlight appears white but actually contains all colors of light in the visible spectrum.",
        "When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it collides with tiny gas molecules.",
        "Blue light has a shorter wavelength and gets scattered more than other colors in a process called Rayleigh scattering.",
        "This scattering of blue light in all directions makes the sky appear blue to our eyes."
      ],
      "ground_truth": "The sky appears blue because blue light from the sun is scattered more than other colors when it interacts with molecules in Earth's atmosphere."

    {
      "question": "How do magnets work?",
      "expected_answer": "Magnets work because they have invisible force fields around them called magnetic fields. These fields can push or pull on certain metals like iron. Magnets have two ends called poles - a north pole and a south pole. Opposite poles (north and south) attract each other, while same poles (north and north, or south and south) push each other away.",
      "contexts": [
        "Magnets create magnetic fields due to the alignment of electrons in their atoms.",
        "Every magnet has two poles: a north pole and a south pole.",

    {
      "question": "What is gravity?",
      "expected_answer": "Gravity is an invisible force that pulls objects toward each other. It's what keeps you on the ground instead of floating away! The bigger and heavier something is, the stronger its gravity. Earth is very big and heavy, so it pulls everything toward it, including you, your toys, and even the air around us.",
      "contexts": [
        "Gravity is a fundamental force of nature that causes objects with mass to attract each other.",
        "The strength of gravitational force depends on the masses of objects and the distance between them.",
        "Earth's gravity pulls objects toward its center, giving them weight.",
        "Gravity keeps planets in orbit around the sun and moons in orbit around planets.",
        "Without gravity, nothing would stay on Earth's surface and everything would float in space."
      ],
      "ground_truth": "Gravity is a natural force that attracts objects with mass toward each other, with stronger attraction between more massive objects and weaker attraction over greater distances."
